# --------- SET YOUR OLED DISPLAY TYPE HERE ----------------
# The library supports three different types of SparkFun boards. The demo uses the following
# variables to determine which device is being used. Uncomment the device being used for this demo.

userOLED = qwiic_oled.QwiicMicroOled()   # Micro OLED             https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14532
# userOLED = qwiic_oled.QwiicOledDisplay() # "Narrow" OLED          https://www.sparkfun.com/products/24606
# userOLED = qwiic_oled.QwiicLargeOled()  # Qwiic OLED 1.3in        https://www.sparkfun.com/products/23453

    #  Before you can start using the OLED, call begin() to init
    #  all of the pins and configure the OLED.

    myOLED = userOLED

    if not myOLED.connected:

            file=sys.stderr)

    myOLED.begin()

    #  clear(ALL) will clear out the OLED's graphic memory.
    myOLED.clear(myOLED.ALL) #  Clear the display's memory (gets rid of artifacts)

    #  To actually draw anything on the display, you must call the display() function.
    myOLED.display()  #  Display buffer contents
    time.sleep(3)

    #  clear(PAGE) will clear the Arduino's display buffer.
    myOLED.clear(myOLED.PAGE)  #  Clear the display's buffer
    
    #  Display buffer contents
